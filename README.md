# Diablo 2 Data Files

These files are the data from the .txt files from d2_patch.mpq, as well as a couple of helpful extra files. Additional files that aren't directly based on existing .txt files are:

- atomic.json (atomic treasure classes that aren't explicitly listed in TreasureClassEx.txt)
- aggregate.json (a collection of the more actionable data such as weapons, armor, experience, etc)
